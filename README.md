# 🦀 Rust Fundamentals: My Journey 🦀

**A Newbie's Rust Adventure**

This repo documents my exploration of Rust fundamentals through the Coursera specialization. 
I'm using AI Pair Programming with GitHub Codespaces and Copilot - let's see how this goes! 🤖🚀

**Goals:**
* 🎯 Master core Rust concepts (ownership, borrowing, concurrency).
* 🏗️ Build simple projects to learn DevOps skills using Rust.

**Let's Rust!** 🦀✨

p.s.
    I'm not a memory leak, I'm just holding onto my friends
    - Why did the programmer cry over their Rust code? 
    - Because the borrow checker kept telling them they couldn't have their cake and eat it
